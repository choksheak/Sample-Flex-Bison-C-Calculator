# Sample-Flex-Bison-C-Calculator

This is sample learning code for a simple calculator program using Flex and Bison. I think this is a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to use Flex and Bison without getting into too many details.

I looked around the web for alternative lexers and parser generators, but in the end still concluded to use Flex and Bison. A notable Flex replacement is re2c, but the documentation seems to be lacking. There are more options for parser generators. The two most notable ones I found were Gold and Lemon. But both do not seem to have the completeness and stability of Bison. Lemon seems to be functionally complete, so that could be a good candidate to consider using in future.

Hopefully this is helpful to someone out there. Have fun!
